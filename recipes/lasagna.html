        <h1>Lovely Layers</h1>
    
    
    Picture this: a quiet Tuesday evening, the kind where the universe seems to be politely nudging you to eat a boring salad. But no! My taste buds had bigger dreams—dreams of layered magnificence, saucy seduction, and cheesy bliss. As I was casually scrolling through the culinary jungle of the internet, dodging recipes that looked like they were trying too hard to be quinoa, this lasagna recipe appeared, shining brighter than a mozzarella-stuffed lighthouse in a stormy sea of mediocre pasta dishes.

I didn't just fall in love with this lasagna; I was swept off my feet like a cartoon character following the aroma of a freshly baked pie. It was love at first bite, with noodles so perfectly cooked they must've been trained in a spa. The ricotta whispered sweet nothings, while the meat sauce sang me a love ballad that would put Barry White to shame.

In short, this lasagna wasn’t just a dish; it was the rom-com of my kitchen, and I was the lead who finally found "the one"—only this time, it was made of pasta, and our happily ever after came with a side of garlic bread.
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6-ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 (6.5-ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt, divided</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>12 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
    <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375F (190C).</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>
    <li>
        In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, Italian sausage, chopped onion, and minced garlic over medium heat until well browned. Drain any excess fat.
        <ul>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.</li>
            <li>Mix in the white sugar, dried basil leaves, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon of salt, and ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and simmer the sauce for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the egg, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, dried oregano, dried thyme, dried marjoram, and a pinch of salt. Mix until well combined.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assemble the lasagna:
        <ul>
            <li>Spread 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
            <li>Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with one-third of the shredded mozzarella cheese and one-third of the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers by adding another 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce, 4 lasagna noodles, another third of the ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Repeat this two more times.</li>
            <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, topped with the remaining sauce and cheeses.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil, ensuring it doesn't touch the cheese to avoid sticking.
        <ul>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 15 minutes to set.</li>
    <li>Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley before serving.</li>
</ol>
